Added:

A lower TE curvature constraint (must be straight or concave)
Moved the max thickenss location back to 0.3 based on other airfoils (and that this constraint keeps being active)

Decrease iteration count to 200

Also:
seeded original population with the full batch of airfoils (thickness stretched)

Move the back flat constraint to be shorter (also change this to be convex, not flat--impose as constraint)
add a delta between back two kulfan parameters constraint (tes are too thin) (but also need max to prevent large wedges)

Revert back to 4:1
Case 32:  FFA TE Gap, 4:1 L/D Weighting, Normal CL

Revert to 4:1 and remove the 40% change (should be Case 25 plus the TE constraint)

Change to 6:1 and remove the 40% change (should be Case 25)

Need:
Modify xfoil to run without restart
Increase number of shape parameters
Remove TE constraint?
Make 30% airfoil have lower surface aft coefficient of negative value?
Increase mutation in the GA?


remove TE constraints, do 6:1

*********Did a complete re-write of the objective function
Case 50:  Total reboot attempt

Case 50: revamp
Case 51: added a constraint that penalizes flare out


Case 52: changed weighting in the objective function (thresholds), change TE cone to 95% not 98%, did some other objective tweaks


Case 53: Making each thickness have a unique objective function 

Case 54: a rerun of case 53

Case 55:  Changed the objective weights for the 27-36, and te gaps for 30-36

Case 56:  Changed the objective weights for all

Case 57:  Made rough L/D a lower constraint, decreased mutation rate to 10% (ga_functions, 259)

Case 58:  Updated objective function, removed the flare out constraint, back to 30% mutation rate

Case 59:  Tweaked objective 

Case 60:  Changed objective again

Case 61:  Changed to different pacc style, changed how randoms are generated, changed where temp files go

Case 62:  Went to 8 upper and lower

Case 63:  Adding CL and rough lod into the filename

Case 64:  Added pre-seeded airfoil shapes to the original population

Case 65:  Added re-runs to the objective function calls

Case 66:  Changed naming convention for output files, handling an error in the thickness calculation

Case 67:  Fixed an indexing issue that appeared with failures on the supercomputer

Case 99: Only quick run changes
Case 98: Changed the output to match
Case 97: Updated most things but not the primary L/D objectives

Case 96: Exactly Case 58
Case 95: Removed all constraints from 96 (kept straight rejects)
Case 94-80: incrementally added the constraints



Add more rough weighting
penalize clean above 200? 190?
Re-do 30%
spar location
Rest of family


rerun the 30
send alan the full family for run on grid
Begin to sweep over many CL input values
Mess with the objective function to observe behavior for paper
Constrain the angle of attack to match existing 22mw as bonus study

spar integraion from the FFA paper---Needs to integrate blade design, do not do this now
    Write a note on this
